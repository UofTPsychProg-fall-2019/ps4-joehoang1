Detail about experiment for assignment 1:
The project that I would be doing involves using Qualtrics studies to examine how different social class of conservatives and liberals influence their lay beliefs in 3 different studies.
In study 1, I would be examining this effect by using a simple correlation study where participants would proceed from one question to the next.
In study 2, I would be examining the effects of lay beliefs on social class. This study would involve a manipulation where half the participants would be randomly assigned to a condition where they would be manipulated to have a more fixed lay belief or a more incremental lay belief. They would then answer a following list of questions that proceed from one question to the next.
In study 3, I would be examining the effects of social class on lay beliefs. This study would follow the same design as study 2 except the variable that is being manipulated is social class.

Study 1:
First block consent form
	If participants answers yes for consent they would be redirected to the next block and answer the questions until it is all finished. It will end with the debrief form. 
	If the participants answer no, they would be redirected to a page that says thank you for their initial interest with the study and that they can now close the browser
Other questions block
	Participants would proceed along the survey answering questions until they are finished and it reaches the debriefing block 
Debriefing block 
	Participants would be given information about the study and consent to us using the data they have provided us. Regardless of what they answer they would be redirected to the end screen thanking them for helping with our study and that they can close the browser now 

Study 2: 
First block consent form
	If participants answers yes for consent they would be redirected to the manipulation block and answer the questions until it is all finished. It will end with the debrief form. 
	If the participants answer no, they would be redirected to a page that says thank you for their initial interest with the study and that they can now close the browser. 
Manipulation block 
	The participants would be randomly assigned to one of two conditions 
		If condition 1 reaches half of the sample we plan to collect (based off the power analysis) then they would automatically be assigned to the manipulation that is not full
Other question blocks
	Participants would proceed along the survey answering questions until they are finished and it reaches the debriefing block 
Debriefing block 
	Participants would be given information about the study and consent to us using the data they have provided us. Regardless of what they answer they would be redirected to the end screen thanking them for helping with our study and that they can close the browser now 

Study 3: 
First block consent form
	If participants answers yes for consent they would be redirected to the manipulation block and answer the questions until it is all finished. It will end with the debrief form.
